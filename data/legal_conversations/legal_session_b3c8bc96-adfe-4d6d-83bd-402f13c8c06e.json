Saudization: Under the Nitaqat program, employers are required to maintain a certain percentage of Saudi nationals in their workforce, as per Ministerial Resolution No. 4040, 1/11/1436H.\n\n**Compliance Procedures:**\n1. Register the employment contract with the Ministry of Labor and Social Development (MLSD).\n2. Enroll in the WPS and ensure timely payment of wages.\n3.
